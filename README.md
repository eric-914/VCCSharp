# VCCSharp
Virtual Color Computer in C#

This is to be a port of the open source VCC ( https://github.com/VCCE/VCC ) into C#.

Plans are:
* Develop in .NET (Core) and WPF.
* To separate the U/I from the emulation as much as possible.

I've already moved all of VCC main into a library, and hope to attach to it.  And over time, start replacing parts of it in C#.
If this works, I'll then work on converting the other modules as well.
