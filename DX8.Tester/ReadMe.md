Original program uses DirectX 8, which is COM based.  Ideally, would like to upgrade this to latest DirectX that plays nicely with C#/.NET.

There's no good way of testing the joystick code in the main app.  This app will be used for such testing.  And maybe other DX testing as well, such as video and sound.
